#
# User/Group: This allows you to set the user and group that will be
# used for tinyproxy after the initial binding to the port has been done
# as the root user. Either the user or group name or the UID or GID
# number may be used.
#
User <%= @user %>
Group <%= @group %>

#
# Port: Specify the port which tinyproxy will listen on.  Please note
# that should you choose to run on a port lower than 1024 you will need
# to start tinyproxy using root.
#
Port <%= @port %>

#
# Listen: If you have multiple interfaces this allows you to bind to
# only one. If this is commented out, tinyproxy will bind to all
# interfaces present.
#
<%- if @listen.nil? -%>
#Listen 192.168.0.1
<%- else -%>
Listen <%= @listen %>

#
# Bind: This allows you to specify which interface will be used for
# outgoing connections.  This is useful for multi-home'd machines where
# you want all traffic to appear outgoing from one particular interface.
#

#Bind 192.168.0.1

# ip address of the incoming connection.

#BindSame yes

BindSame <%= @bind_same %>

#
# Timeout: The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
# allowed to have before it is closed by tinyproxy.
#
Timeout <%= @timeout %>

#
# ErrorFile: Defines the HTML file to send when a given HTTP error
# occurs.  You will probably need to customize the location to your
# particular install.  The usual locations to check are:
#   /usr/local/share/tinyproxy
#   /usr/share/tinyproxy

# DefaultErrorFile: The HTML file that gets sent if there is no
# HTML file defined with an ErrorFile keyword for the HTTP error
# that has occured.
#
DefaultErrorFile "<%= @default_error_file %>"

#
# StatHost: This configures the host name or IP address that is treated
# as the stat host: Whenever a request for this host is received,
# Tinyproxy will return an internal statistics page instead of
# forwarding the request to that host.  The default value of StatHost is
# tinyproxy.stats.

#
# StatFile: The HTML file that gets sent when a request is made
# for the stathost.  If this file doesn't exist a basic page is
# hardcoded in tinyproxy.
#
StatFile "<%= @stat_file %>"

#
# LogFile: Allows you to specify the location where information should
# be logged to.  If you would prefer to log to syslog, then disable this
# and enable the Syslog directive.  These directives are mutually
# exclusive.

#Syslog On
<%- else -%>

#
# LogLevel:
#
# Set the logging level. Allowed settings are:
#	Critical	(least verbose)
#	Error
#	Warning
#	Notice
#	Connect		(to log connections without Info's noise)
#	Info		(most verbose)
#
# The LogLevel logs from the set level and above. For example, if the
# LogLevel was set to Warning, then all log messages from Warning to
# Critical would be output, but Notice and below would be suppressed.
#
LogLevel <%= @log_level %>

#
# PidFile: Write the PID of the main tinyproxy thread to this file so it
# can be used for signalling purposes.
#
PidFile "<%= @pid_file %>"

#
# XTinyproxy: Tell Tinyproxy to include the X-Tinyproxy header, which
# contains the client's IP address.

#
# Upstream:
#
# Turns on upstream proxy support.
#
# The upstream rules allow you to selectively route upstream connections
# based on the host/domain of the site being accessed.
#
# For example:
#  # connection to test domain goes through testproxy
#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".test.domain.invalid"
#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".our_testbed.example.com"
#  upstream testproxy:8008 "192.168.128.0/255.255.254.0"
#
#  # no upstream proxy for internal websites and unqualified hosts
#  no upstream ".internal.example.com"
#  no upstream "www.example.com"
#  no upstream "10.0.0.0/8"
#  no upstream "192.168.0.0/255.255.254.0"
#  no upstream "."
#
#  # connection to these boxes go through their DMZ firewalls
#  upstream cust1_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust1"
#  upstream cust2_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust2"
#
#  # default upstream is internet firewall
#  upstream firewall.internal.example.com:80
#
# The LAST matching rule wins the route decision.  As you can see, you
# can use a host, or a domain:
#  name     matches host exactly
#  .name    matches any host in domain "name"
#  .        matches any host with no domain (in 'empty' domain)
#  IP/bits  matches network/mask
#  IP/mask  matches network/mask

# disables thread reaping. If you do notice problems with memory
# leakage, then set this to something like 10000.

# Allow: Customization of authorization controls. If there are any

# DisableViaHeader: When this is set to yes, Tinyproxy does NOT add
# the Via header to the requests. This virtually puts Tinyproxy into
